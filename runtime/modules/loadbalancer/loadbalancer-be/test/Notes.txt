Ack processing:
    Whats the point of sending the acks to a different server?
    Find if there are other sessions connected to that server and relay the acks - by transferring to that session?



==========================================




Config driven:
    Do not drop message on error
    Do not expect acks

Ack service:
    SimpleMemberCodec
    SinkStatus needs to be cleared periodically to avoid mem leaks

JMS message formats:
    file:///C:/tibco/be/4.0/doc/standard/html/tib_be_developers_guide/channels.7.12.htm#2389341

FT:
    What if the servers are running in max-active mode?

JMX:
    Basic stats
    Forcing
        Membership suspect
        Sink restart
        Unmark sink and member

Routing:
    Table cleanup
    Hash faster using FNV

API:
    Expose distribution as a library - findNodes(key)

Unit tests:
    Clean up

Error handling:
    Boot time:
        Starting up with some undeleted files

    TCP:
        Add debug to client and then kill client - server gets stuck on attemptsend

        Client crash?
        Server crash?
        How long can we wait for acks?
        Ping header + ts (ntp)
        Respond with ts

        Client and Sender need a way to reconnect TCP on error
        Header/message corruption:
            Header not received
            Content len not received
            Recover from corrupt stream - Terminate reader and send last intact message Id seen. Then reconnect.
