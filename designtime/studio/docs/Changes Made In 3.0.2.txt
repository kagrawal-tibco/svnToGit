HIGH LEVEL:

- ESP
- EMM
- Debugger
- DM/RMS changes
- HTTP/SOAP channels
- BE Portal
- JDBC data stores.



********** Added on 4/7/09:

- Completely redesigned Debugger

- New EMM tool (see tibco/be/3.0/emm), can monitor/manage BE clusters

- New HTTP(s)/SOAP channel

- Engine improvements (see BE-3.x-4.0-Scope.xls in prodmgmt trunk)

- Designer improvements, Rule/State Machines stored in separate files)

- Added checkbox per decision table to decide whether table should continue to execute even after it finds one set of conditions that is true.

- Added ability to export result test data.

- added abiliy to set ACL to decide whether users are forced to use domain values in their cells, or whether they can override it and type whatever they want. Checkbox is also added in domain model editor for users to decide themselves if they want to allow themselves to do this. This checkbox can only be changed if the ACL gives them the right to decide.

- DM can handle database concepts now (extended properties)

- support other LDAP servers by externalizing search parameters

- import/export domain models to Excel (if users decides to). Excel sheets also use this domain model if defined (dropdown lists are displayed)

- RMS uses newly exposed HTTP channel

- DM can use SSL to communicate with RMS. Significant optional SSL configuration (DM: wizard. RMS: tra file).

- Ability to automatically open last project (controlled via Preferences)

- Open last 4 opened projects (File -> Switch Project)

- Ability to rename a decision table (File -> Rename)

- can overwrite existing table when importing from Excel

- tables have priorities (useful if you have multiple tables per VRF and want BU to control order of invokation)

- DateTime calendar wizard for DateTime properties (mouse over cell and you can click to activate it)

- "Constraints Pane" added to Decision table view to allow for table analysis, test data generation (WIP)

- Close Project added to Project Explorer context menu
- Validate Table icon added to toolbar
- other bug fixes

********** Added on 4/8/09:

- added support to populate domain models from databases via DBConcepts

- added support for primitives in decision tables (if VRF has primitives as arguments, you can now add columns based on it, drag and drop, etc).

- added ability to control entity property modifications via ACL in actions/custom actions

- Fixed issue where older Berkeley DB persisted store could not be used with new RMS.


********** Added on 4/15/09:

- ability to open last few projects from File menu

- last authentication/checkout URLS are not persisted (dropdown menu shows you last 4 URLs)

- Username/password combination (last successful login) is stored with encrypted password.

- table property now shown in Properties view along with cell/row properties (new tab added)

- column headers exported when exporting test data results

- ability to merge from Excel into existing tables (!)


********** Added on 4/28/09:

- merging from Excel into existing tables works from GUI and from command-line. Preferences added to make certain decisions about how to merge

- GUI so users can populate domain models from database via domain model editor (via DB concepts)

- warn user before comitting a projec that has validation errors

- command-line interface for decision project generation, update, table import, table export, table compilation, table loading into BE engine. Allows for automated testing. table import supports same merging capabilities GUI has.

- can copy error dialog boxes and show error messages/exceptions in DM

- authentication info, login status, project path shown in DM status bar

- can save password for authentication (checkbox)
