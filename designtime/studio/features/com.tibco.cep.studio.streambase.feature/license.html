A service charge of one and one-half percent per month (or such lower amount as permitted by applicable law) will be applied to all fees and charges that are not paid on time.  Customer agrees to pay all sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption, withholding, excise and any other similar taxes or government charges, exclusive of Licensor’s income taxes. Except as set forth in the “Termination” or "Remedies" section, all fees and charges paid under or in connection with these Terms are non-refundable and no right of set off exists.

<p>5. Proprietary Notices.  Licensor Software, Materials, and Documentation are proprietary to Licensor and its licensors and protected by applicable U.S. and international patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws.  Licensor and its licensors shall retain ownership in the Licensor Software, Materials and Documentation, all derivatives thereof, and any intellectual property or other rights embodied therein. All proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Licensor Software, Materials and Documentation, must be duplicated by Customer on all copies of the Licensor Software, Materials and Documentation, as applicable, and must not be altered, removed or obliterated. Except as stated herein, Customer receives no other rights to use any of Licensor's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. </p>
<p>6. Confidentiality.  “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by either party, whether or not marked, including, without limitation, the provisions of these Terms and any Order Form, the Licensor Software, Materials, individual contact information provided by either party or related performance test results derived by Customer, including but not limited to benchmark test results, Protected Data and Output. Each party agrees to protect Confidential Information in the same manner as it protects its own (but using no less than a reasonable degree of protection) and may only disclose Confidential Information to those with a need to know that information and who have agreed in writing to be bound by terms at least as protective as those contained in these Terms.

Each party agrees to indemnify the other for any damages (including reasonable expenses) the other may sustain resulting from the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of the other's Confidential Information and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. The parties are entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief shall not be the exclusive remedy for any breach of confidentiality, but is in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Licensor’s source code shall be kept confidential in perpetuity. Affiliates of either party are included in the definition of “Licensor” and “Customer”, respectively, for purposes of this Section entitled “Confidentiality”.  Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party, and each party acknowledges and agrees that it does not acquire any rights therein. Use by a recipient of Confidential Information for the purposes contemplated under these Terms, including, but not limited to, any configuration or use by Customer of the Licensor Software or Materials, does not affect or diminish the disclosing party’s rights, title and interest in and to Confidential Information.</p>

Furthermore, Licensor will indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against any damages, costs and fees reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are attributable to such claim or action and which are assessed against Customer in a final judgment (“Indemnity”).

<p>17. General Provisions. </p>
<p> Additional license requirements and other license notices, if any, shall be contained in the Documentation that is delivered with the applicable Licensor Software.  Unless expressly authorized by such terms, Customer agrees not to use or access any third-party software as a stand-alone product or in any other manner other than in connection with the Licensor Software. </p>
<p>  All notices related to these Terms shall be in writing. Notices will be effective if dispatched by facsimile; or electronic mail; by hand; reliable overnight delivery service or first-class, pre-paid mail if sent to the contract address for the intended recipient set forth in an Order Form. A copy of any notice of default, breach or termination shall also be sent to that party's General Counsel.</p>
<p> The losing party shall pay all reasonable costs, including, without limitation attorneys’ fees, incurred by the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce the prevailing party’s rights under these Terms. </p>
<p> The Terms shall not be interpreted to create an agency or consignment relationship, and neither party is a partner, employee, agent or joint venture partner of, or with, the other.  During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one (1) year following expiration or termination of an Order Form, neither party shall actively solicit for employment any employee, contractor, or consultant, or other representative of the other party who performed services in connection with the applicable Order Form, without the prior written consent of the other party.</p>
<p> Customer hereby grants Licensor and its independent auditors, at Licensor's expense, the right to audit Customer‘s compliance with these Terms upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times and to report any results to Licensor’s licensors. Customer agrees to provide assistance to ensure a complete and accurate audit by Licensor and its independent auditors.  Customer’s failure to comply with the provisions of this section will constitute a material breach of these Terms.</p>
<p> No waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of these Terms shall be construed as a waiver of that or any other provision on any other occasion.</p>
<p> Dates or times by which one party is required to perform under these Terms shall be postponed automatically for so long as that party is prevented from performing by any act of or failure to act by, the other party.  No delay or default in performance of any obligation by either party (except payment obligations), shall constitute a breach of these Terms to the extent caused by force majeure or any other cause which is beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, fires, strikes, accidents, or acts of God.</p>
<p> Except for an assignment, in whole or part, by Licensor to a wholly owned subsidiary, neither party may assign these Terms and/or any of its rights and/or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any such attempted assignment shall be void. For the purposes of the foregoing, a change in control of Customer is deemed to cause or attempt to cause an assignment of these Terms and shall require Licensor’s prior written consent.</p>
<p> To the extent Customer or its successors or assigns enters into an Extraordinary Corporate Event after an Order Form Effective Date, these Terms, as amended, shall not apply to those additional users, divisions or entities, which were added to or divested from Customer’s organization as a result of the Extraordinary Corporate Event until those additional users, divisions or entities are added to these Terms by way of a written amendment signed by duly authorized officers of the Licensor and Customer.</p>
<p> The parties' rights and obligations under this section and sections entitled "Fees", “Warranties”, “Indemnity”, “Remedies”, “Disclaimers”, “Exclusions”, “Limitation of Liability”, “Proprietary Notices”, "Confidentiality", "General" shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.</p>
<p> If Customer is entering into these Terms from a European Union member country, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, India or Australia, then these Terms are governed by the laws of England and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.  Otherwise, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Federal Court for the Northern District Court of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Terms.</p>
<p> These Terms, which hereby incorporate by reference any terms or information contained in a URL or referenced policy, together with any Order Form, constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the parties’ agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous proposals, representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings relating to the same. If any sentence, clause or other provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, including, but not limited to, any limitation of liability, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining clauses and provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. The affected provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to render it enforceable while attempting to closely approximate the intent and the economic effect of the affected provision. </p>
