<h1>BQL Console (BE Query Language)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>TIBCO BusinessEvents&reg; Query Language (BQL) Console allows you to write
   and execute snapshot queries, continuous queries or snapshot then continuous queries and get data from the
   BusinessEvents distributed cache. The query works with the ontology
   definitions defined the TIBCO BusinessEvents&reg; EAR (enterprise archive file).

   For more details on the query language features, see TIBCO
   BusinessEvents Event Stream Processing Query Developer's Guide.</p>
</p>

<h2>How to use BQL</h2>

<ul>
<li>
	<p>BQL console requires a valid CDD file and EAR file. The CDD must
   have at least one Query Agent defined. You can launch a console for
   each query agent in the CDD.
	</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p>To execute queries using BQL, the CDD must be configured for at least
   one inference agent and one cache agent, and the cluster must be
   running.
	</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p>You add a property to the Query Agent class in the CDD file, so that
   BQL Console displays when the processing unit starts. The console
   itself has an instance of the query agent running, to back it. This
   Query Agent behaves like a regular Query Agent. It joins the cluster
   and receives notifications from the cache.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>When you type queries into the console, they are executed against
   the objects in the cache.
	</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p>Note that any Startup and Shutdown functions for the Query Agent,
   and any channels defined for the Processing Unit are disabled for
   safety reasons.
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2> How to run BQL </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy bql.jar from <i>BE_HOME</i>/examples/event_stream_processing/bql directory to <i>BE_HOME</i>/lib.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the CDD file, add the following property to the processing
      unit definition:
      <b>be.agent.query.console=&lt;QUERY_AGENT_NAME(s)&gt;</b>
      Replace QUERY_AGENT_NAME with the name of the Query Agent. If
      multiple query agents are defined and you want to run a console
      for more than one agent, add the agent names as a comma separated
      list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the TIBCO BusinessEvents process at the command line using the
      CDD file you configured in step 2:</p>
	  <pre class="commands">
		cd <i>BE_HOME</i>/bin
		<i>BE_HOME</i>/bin/be-engine --propFile be-engine.tra -c &lt;CDD file&gt; -u &lt;processing unit id&gt; &lt;EAR file&gt;
	  </pre>
	  <p>Adapt the command as needed, for example, if you have customized the example project, or are running it from a different directory. See <i>TIBCO BusinessEvents Administration</i> for more details about
      starting the process at the command line.</p>
</li>

</ol>
