# Here is an example of the format of the list and the 'legal' keywords:
#
# a)		d1/d2/d3/xyz.c	1.4
#
#	Release version 1.4.
#
# b)		d1/d2/d3/xyz.c	RM
#
#	Remove the file from the release branch (the file will still
#	live in the development branch). In the CVS case this means
#	simply remove the release branch tag.
#
# c)		d1/d2/d3/xyz.c	P4RM (CVSRM)
#
#	Remove the file from both the development and the release branches.
#	In the CVS case this means removing the release branch tag from the
#	file and either remove the development branch tag from the file or
#	cvs-remove the file from the main branch (if the development branch is
#	the main branch itself).
#
# "d1/d2/d3" is a path relative to the root of the source repository.
